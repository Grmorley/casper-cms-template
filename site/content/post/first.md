We are raising money for the IFAW because our wonderful mum, Patricia Hall, passed away.

On Wednesday 9th October our mum, Patricia Hall, passed away peacefully at North Middlesex Hospital after bravely battling against Parkinson’s Disease for many years, as well as dementia and mobility problems caused by 2 hip fractures. She was a remarkable woman, and the best mum anyone could have and we are all devastated by our loss. It’s been a very sad period in our lives as we also lost our brother, David, on Christmas Eve last year.

Mum was born in Newham, and her school life was disrupted by the war. She was never at one school for very long before having to move to another, and she always said that this made it difficult for her to excel in areas where she might otherwise have done. After leaving school she trained as a nurse and worked in the Prince of Wales Hospital until she was forced to give up when she married our father, Fred.  His parents, “Big Fred” and Jane, ran a greengrocer’s stall in Tottenham and both came from long time trading backgrounds.

It wasn’t long before there was a growing family and after a few years of shared houses in Tottenham, Mum and Dad moved to a big house in Ponders End.  There were fours sons, Geoff, Dave, Andy and John, and they kept Mum fully occupied for many years. She remembered the years of trudging up and down the road to Southbury School. 

Eventually we were old enough to be left, and Mum did a succession of part time jobs.  The most memorable was when she was making keyrings for a Watneys Red Barrel promotion, and brought one of the machines home so that we could all help. There were other jobs in the light engineering companies that existed at the time, plus a time in the Civil Service and a time in retail with a sports shop.

While we were in Ponders End, Mum got the first in a long succession of dogs.  She loved taking them for walks, and often became friends with other people she met on the way. 

There was an eventual move to Bullsmoor Lane, It was not long after this that her mother in law Jane became ill and she became involved with the Tottenham shop, which by now was in dire financial straights.  Mum helped turn that situation around, working on everything from the shopfittings to the accounts,   The work was arduous but she kept at it year after year.

Through all this time we remember how Mum would be a help to anyone. We remember her helping out our Uncle Stan, who by then was in his late Eighties and early Nineties, and someone perhaps as capable and independent as she was but also living alone.  She would visit at least once a week, taking food or running errands.

In her later years mum battled against a number of health problems. We are not sure exactly how long mum had Parkinson’s Disease, but it must have been at least 15. She also suffered a very bad hip fracture in 2013. Before that she was still managing to walk with the aid of a stick but afterwards she needed a walking frame. Two years after the first hip fracture she had another fall and broke her other hip. The combination of Parkinson’s and the 2 hip fractures took away her independence, which was particularly cruel for such an active person. The onset of dementia only made things harder. 

In recent months she developed dysphagia (swallowing difficulties) caused by Parkinson’s which meant she could only eat pureed foods, often only about half a teaspoon at a time. She fought against all of these with amazing dignity and courage. Even the day before she passed away as she lay on the hospital bed drifting in and out of consciousness, she was still trying to do hand exercises. 

Despite all of these problems mum remained in her own home where John and Andy cared for her, with the personal care being done by a local care agency. Her devoted dog Bobby also helped with his amazing sense that he needed to tell whoever was in the house when mum woke up. He knew she always had to have help and took at as his duty to alert whoever was in the house. 

Mum loved music, gardening and especially enjoyed dog walking and had a wider love for animals. She used to walk so fast it was very difficult to keep up with her! Dogs were a big part of her life, with the house always having at least one if not two dogs in, and even cats as well at some points. A number of the dogs and cats she had were ones she had rescued, which is typical of her nature. Mum’s love for animals is reflected in the charities she gave to, which were always animal charities. 

One charity we remember her supporting for many years is the International Fund for Animal Welfare, so we have chosen this charity as the most appropriate for donations in her memory. If you could make a donation in order for us to reach our target and hopefully beyond it would be much appreciated. It would mean a lot for us to raise as much as possible to honour a remarkable woman, and the best mum we could ever have wished for.

Geoff, Andy and John Hall
